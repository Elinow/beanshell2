This is the fork of [beanshell.org](http://www.beanshell.org/) called Beanshell2 which lived between 2011 and
2014 at [code.google.com](https://code.google.com/p/beanshell2). The motivation of the fork was that the
original author was no longer maintaining it.

In 2015 the repository moved here when Google retired their code hosting site. 

The old version is again maintained at [github.com/beanshell](https://github.com/beanshell). There is some
ongoing effort to integrate the changes and improvements made to the project there. 

The development branch here is [v2.1](https://github.com/pejobo/beanshell2/tree/v2.1), the latest 'released'
version is 
[2.1.9](https://github.com/pejobo/beanshell2/raw/v2.1/dist/bsh-2.1.9.jar)
which maps to commit
[a70056fbe9727d8eadf8e21f3089cbe9f4f0913e](https://github.com/pejobo/beanshell2/commit/a70056fbe9727d8eadf8e21f3089cbe9f4f0913e).

See [releases page](https://github.com/pejobo/beanshell2/dist/README.md) for more information.
