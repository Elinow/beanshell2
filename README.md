This is the fork of [beanshell.org](http://www.beanshell.org/) called Beanshell2 which lived some time at [code.google.com](https://code.google.com/p/beanshell2) before the site closed and the code was moved here.

The branch of development is [v2.1](https://github.com/pejobo/beanshell2/tree/v2.1), the latest 'released' version is [2.1.8](https://github.com/pejobo/beanshell2/raw/5b925f056c7a4b192fcd7389c9362d4f43403f70/downloads/bsh-2.1.8.jar) which maps to commit [5b925f056c7a4b192fcd7389c9362d4f43403f70](https://github.com/pejobo/beanshell2/commit/5b925f056c7a4b192fcd7389c9362d4f43403f70).

The code changes after forking from original beanshell will be eventually integrated to [github.com/beanshell](https://github.com/beanshell/beanshell), which was initially an apache incubation project.
Even so the project never left incubation there still seems to be a need for a scripting languages on the jvm which doesn't compile to byte code. Beanshell still serves this purpose.
